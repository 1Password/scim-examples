# Beta deployments

This folder contains beta versions of 1Password SCIM bridge deployments.

These deployments _should_ work, but come with no guarantees, and will change in the future.

> **Note**  
> "Beta" refers solely to the deployment _method_. It does not refer to the SCIM bridge software being deployed.

## What are "beta" deployment examples?

We want to provide people deploying 1Password SCIM Bridge with deployment examples suitable for a range of skill levels, environments, and budgets. As part of those efforts, we may choose to make deployment examples available in "beta" form. This gives people deploying 1Password SCIM Bridge more options and provides us with feedback we can use to enhance the deployment example.

### What does "beta" mean?

"Beta" refers to the deployment example. It does not refer to the software being deployed, which in this case is 1Password SCIM Bridge. You will always be deploying a stable version of 1Password SCIM Bridge, regardless of how you've deployed it.

Generally speaking, any new deployment example will start in beta. This allows us better-assesss where documentation could be enhanced, where the deployment could be improved, identify edge-cases we need to accommodate, and so on.

### Is there greater risk associated with beta deployment examples?

Because the software being deployed (1Password SCIM Bridge) is not in beta, there is minimal additional risk associated with using beta deployment examples.

However, due to beta deployment examples being newer, there is a small risk of unforseen challenges with deployment, maintenance, or performance over time.

## Publishing beta deployment example

This section describes:

- The criteria to determine when deployment example is ready to be published with the "beta" label.
- The process for publishing a beta deployment example.

<!-- Criteria and process go here -->

## Graduating a deployment example out of beta

This section describes:

- The criteria for removing the "beta" label from a deployment example.
- The process for graduating a deployment example from beta to stable.

<!-- Criteria and process go here -->

## Deprecating a beta deployment example

If a deployment method is to be removed while in beta, the [standard procedures for deprecating deployment methods](../deprecated/README.md) should be followed.
