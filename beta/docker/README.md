# Deploy 1Password SCIM Bridge in a single-node Docker Swarm

This example includes a Docker Compose template file in [the Compose specification](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) format and describes how to deploy 1Password SCIM Bridge as a stack to a single-node Docker swarm.

## In this folder

- [`README.md`](./README.md): the document that you are reading. ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜ƒ
- [`compose.template.yaml`](./compose.template.yaml): a [Compose file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/03-compose-file/) used as a base configuration for 1Password SCIM Bridge.
- [`compose.gw.yaml`](./compose.gw.yaml): an override configuration to merge the configuration necessary for customers integrating with Google Workspace.
- [`redis.conf`](./redis.conf): a Redis confguration file for configuring the Redis cache
- [`scim.env`](./scim.env): an environment file for configuring SCIM bridge

## Overview

## Prerequisites

- Linux server supporting Docker Engine
- Docker Engine (v20.10.3+) (see [Docker Engine installation overview](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server))
- Docker Compose (v2.0+) (see [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/))
- public DNS record pointing to the Docker host

## Get started

1. Create a DNS record that points to your Docker host, e.g. `scim.example.com`.

2. Clone this repository and switch to this directory:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/1Password/scim-examples.git
    cd ./scim-examples/beta/docker
    ```

3. Initialize the Docker Swarm. Run this command on your Docker host:

   ```sh
   docker swarm init
   ```

4. Copy your `scimsesion` file to the working directory.

   > **Note**
   >
   > If you are deploying SCIM bridge directly on a remote Docker host, you will need to transfer the `scimsession` file
   > from your local machine that is signed in to your 1Password account, for example:
   >
   > ```sh
   > scp ./scimsession user@host:scim-examples/beta/docker/scimsession
   > ```

### Configure 1Password SCIM bridge to connect to Google Workspace

If integrating 1Password with Google Workspace, additional cofiguration is required. See [Connect Google Workspace to 1Password SCIM Bridge](https://support.1password.com/scim-google-workspace/#step-1-create-a-google-service-account-key-and-api-client) for instructions to create the service account, key, and API client.

1. Copy the Google Workspace service account key to the working directory.

   > **Note**
   >
   > If you are deploying SCIM bridge directly on a remote Docker host, you will need to transfer the Workspace credentials file
   > from your local machine that is signed in to your 1Password account, for example:
   >
   > ```sh
   >  scp local/path/to/workspace-credentials.json user@host:scim-examples/beta/docker/workspace-credentials.json
   > ```

2. Copy the [settings file template](/beta/workspace-settings.json) from this repository:

    ```sh
    cp ../workspace-settings.json ./workspace-settings.json
    ```

    Edit the file. Replace the values for each key:

    - `actor`: the email address for the administrator that the service account is acting on behalf of
    - `bridgeAddress`: the URL for your SCIM bridge based on the DNS record created in [Get started](#get-started)

    ```json
    {
        "actor":"admin@example.com",
        "bridgeAddress":"https://scim.example.com"
    }
    ```

    Save the file.

## Deploy 1Password SCIM bridge

After the DNS record has propagated, set the DNS name for your SCIM bridge, use the template to output a canonical configuration,  create a Docker Swarm Secret, and deploy SCIM bridge. it will be configured to use Let's Encrypt to create and manage a TLS certificate using its domain name.

*Example command:*

```sh
OP_TLS_DOMAIN=scim.example.com docker stack config --compose-file ./compose.base.yaml |
    docker stack deploy --compose-file - op-scim-bridge
```

Replace `scim.example.com` with the DNS name that points to your Docker host, then run the command to deploy your SCIM bridge.

### Connect your SCIM bridge to Google Workspace

If you are integrating with Google Workspace,use `compose.gw.yaml` to create the additional Docker Swarm Secrets needed for Workspace.

*Example command:*

```sh
OP_TLS_DOMAIN=scim.example.com docker stack config \
    --compose-file ./compose.template.yaml \
    --compose-file ./compose.gw.yaml |
        docker stack deploy --compose-file - op-scim-bridge
```

Replace `scim.example.com` with the DNS name that points to your Docker host, then run the command to deploy SCIM bridge with access to the required configuration and credentials.

## Appendix

### Update 1Password SCIM bridge

Update you SCIM bridge to the latest version by updating its service definition:

```sh
docker service update op-scim-bridge_scim --image 1password/scim:v2.8.2
```
