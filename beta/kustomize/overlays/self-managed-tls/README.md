# Self-Managed TLS

If you'd rather bring your own TLS certificate, this overlay offers you that ability.

To use your own TLS certificate with CertificateManager, add your TLS key file and TLS cert file to this folder, named `tls.key` and `tls.cert` respectively. The private key must be PEM encoded.
