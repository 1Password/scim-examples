# Deploy 1Password SCIM Bridge with AWS CloudFormation

_Learn how to deploy 1Password SCIM Bridge using [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/index.html)._

This guide can be used to deploy 1Password SCIM Bridge as a [stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-whatis-concepts.html#cfn-concepts-stacks) using the [AWS CloudFormation console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-using-console.html).

The included [AWS CloudFormation template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stack-templates-overview.html) template is a working example. It is suitable for use as is in a production environment without modification. Some common customizations are included for convenience, but it is intentionally minimal for simplicity, to allow any identity provider to connect to its public endpoint, and to facilitate its use as a base for a custom deployment that meets your specific requirements.

## Prerequisites

- A 1Password account with an active 1Password Business subscription or trial
> [!TIP]
> Try 1Password Business **free** for 14 days: <https://start.1password.com/sign-up/business>
- An AWS account with the permissions and available quota to create and manage the described resources

## Before you begin

Before deploying 1Password SCIM Bridge, consult the [Preparation Guide](/PREPARATION.md) in this repository. Since this CloudFormation template will create all necessary resources, it does not use the CertificateManager component to create and manage a TLS certificate. You will need to create DNS records if you are not using Route 53 as your DNS provider.

1. Download the [`op-scim-bridge.yaml`](./op-scim-bridge.yaml) template file from this repository to your computer.
2. Follow the steps in [Automate provisioning in 1Password Business using SCIM](https://support.1password.com/scim/#step-1-set-up-and-deploy-1password-scim-bridge) to generate credentials for your SCIM bridge.
3. Save the `scimsession` credentials file and the associated bearer token as items in your 1Password account.
4. Download the `scimsession` file to your computer.

## Step 1: Upload the stack template file

1. Sign in to AWS and [create a stack](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/create).
2. In the **Prerequisite - Prepare template** section, select **Choose an existing template**.
3. In the **Specify template** section, choose **Upload a template file**.
4. Click **↑ Choose file** and upload the [`op-scim-bridge.yaml`](./op-scim-bridge.yaml) template file from your computer. Click **Next**.

## Step 2: Specify stack details

1. Type `op-scim-bridge` in the **Stack name** field, or choose your own stack name. CloudFormation will use the stack name (or a truncated version where needed) as a prefix when naming the created AWS resources.
2. To use an existing VPC, input its ID in the **VPC ID** field. The stack will create a new VPC with two public subnets and associated resources if this field is empty.
3. A CIDR block must be specified when creating a VPC. If creating a VPC with the stack, use the default value provided or specify your own in the **VPC CIDR** field. This field is ignored when specifying a VPC ID.
4. If specifying an existing VPC, input a comma-separated list of IDs for at least two public subnet IDs in the **Public subnets** field. The subnets must span at least two Avilability Zones. This field is required when using an existing VPC and ignored otherwise.
5. To use Route 53 as your DNS provider and create all necessary DNS records in a hosted zone, specify its ID in the **Route 53 hosted zone** field. Required DNS records will not be automatically created if this field is blank.
6. If you are provisioning more than 1,000 users to 1Password, choose the appropriate value for **Provisioning volume**. Choose `high` for up to 5,000 users, or `very-high` for more than 5.000.
7. In the **1Password SCIM Bridge** domain name field, replace `scim.example.com` with a domain name for your SCIM bridge. If using Route 53, it must be in the domain of the specified hosted zone.
8. Open the `scimsession` file from your working directory in a text editor. Select all text in the file and copy it to your clipboard. Paste the contents into the `scimession` field (the input will be masked).
9. **If Google Workspace is your identity provider**, [create a service account, key, and API client](https://support.1password.com/scim-google-workspace/#step-1-create-a-google-service-account-key-and-api-client). Save the Google Workspace service account key file to your computer, open the file in a text editor, select all text in the file, and copy it to your clipboard. In the **Workspace configuration** section:
   - Paste the contents of the key file (from your clipboard) into the **Service account key** field (the input will be masked).
   - Input the email address for a Google Workspace administrator to use with the service account in the **Actor** field.
10. Click **Next**.

## Step 3: Configure stack options

1. Click **Add new tag** to add any that you require to all supported resources in the stack.
2. Review the options. Use the provided defaults or your own options as required or preferred. Click **Next**.

## Step 4: Review and create the stack

1. Review the details and edit as necessary.
2. Select **I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources**.
3. Click **Submit** to begin deploying the stack.

The console will display the stack status as `ℹ️ CREATE_IN_PROGRESS` during the deployment. The stack is expected to take several minutes to create (about 5 minutes when this document was written).

### Step 4.1: Create DNS records

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you specified a Route 53 hosted zone, this step is **not** necessary; the stack will include all necessary DNS records.

If you did _not_ specify a Route 53 hosted zone, you must create two public CNAME records in your DNS provider to validate owernship of your domain with AWS Certificate Manager and point to the load balancer's public endpoint. It is expected that DNS records may take several minutes to propagate. CloudFormation provides the name and value for the records:

1. In the CloudFormation console, select the **Events** tab. Events are displayed in descending order by their timestamp. When the stack begins creating the certificate, an event associated with the `TLSCertificate` resource is logged with `ℹ️ CREATE_IN_PROGRESS` status.
2. Use the **Name** and **Value** from the **Status reason** message associated with the event to create a public CNAME record. Another event associated with the `TLSCertificate` resource is logged with status `✅ CREATE_COMPLETE` after AWS Certificate Manager validates the record. This may take several minutes.
3. After all stack resources are created, an event associated with the name of the stack (for example, `op-scim-bridge`) is logged with status `✅ CREATE_COMPLETE`. Click the **Outputs** tab. Use the `CNAMEName` and `CNAMEValue` values to create another public CNAME record.

## Step 5: Test your SCIM bridge

Your **SCIM bridge URL** is displayed in the **Outputs** tab of the CloudFormation console. Click the link to access the web interface for your SCIM bridge. Sign in using your bearer token to test the connection, view status information, and download logs.

To test the connection and view the same status information in your terminal, you can send an authenticated request to the `/health` endpoint of your SCIM bridge. Replace `mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM` with your bearer token and `https://scim.example.com` with your SCIM bridge URL.

```sh
curl --silent --show-error --request GET --header "Accept: application/json" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM" \
  https://scim.example.com/health
```

> [!TIP]
> If you saved your bearer token as an item in your 1Password account, you can [use 1Password CLI to supply the bearer token](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/secrets-scripts#option-2-use-op-read-to-read-secrets) instead. For example:
>
> ```sh
> # ...
>   --header "Authorization: Bearer $(op read "op://Private/bearer token/credential")"
> # ...
> ```

## Step 6: Connect your identity provider

Use your SCIM bridge URL and bearer token to [connect your identity provider to 1Password SCIM Bridge](https://support.1password.com/scim/#step-3-connect-your-identity-provider).

If you are integrating with Google Workspace, sign in to your SCIM bridge URL using your bearer token and [set up provisioning to 1Password](https://support.1password.com/scim-google-workspace/#22-set-up-provisioning-to-1password).

## Maintenance

A quarterly review and maintenance schedule is recommended.

### Update your SCIM bridge

To update to the latest version of 1Password SCIM Bridge, update your stack with a new value for the `SCIMBridgeVersion` parameter. Use the latest template from this repository ([`op-scim-bridge.yaml`](./op-scim-bridge.yaml)) and update the value of "1Password SCIM Bridge version" (the `SCIMBridgeVersion` parameter) to the latest version. Use the existing values for everything else.
