# Deploying the 1Password SCIM Bridge in AWS/Terraform

This document describes deploying the 1Password SCIM bridge to your Amazon Web Service cloud services using Terraform.


## Preparing

This is only an example of how you could deploy the 1Password SCIM Bridge to your existing AWS infrastructure. Utilizing the full suite of AWS/Terraform infrastructure is considered an advanced form of deployment, so feel free to modify it to suit your needs.

If you find that you are not using a majority of the services listed in this documentation within your AWS account - for instance, you have an external DNS provider, or you are providing your own certificates through a third-party service - consider deploying through [Kubernetes](https://github.com/1Password/scim-examples/tree/master/kubernetes/README.md) using AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). The 1Password SCIM Bridge is not a resource-intensive service, and a full AWS deployment may include more infrastructure than you require, unless it fits neatly into your existing setup.

To continue, please ensure you've read through [PREPARING.md](https://github.com/1Password/scim-examples/tree/master/PREPARING.md) before beginning deployment.


## Deployment overview

### Required Tools

The minimum supported version of Terraform is `0.12.x`.

You will also want to ensure the `aws` and `terraform` CLI tools are installed for your operating system.


### Instance Size

For most installations, one `t3.micro` size instance will be adequate to serve Identity Provider requests. We recommend enabling auto-scaling, but it is not strictly necessary.


### AWS Components

* **AWS Elastic Compute Cloud** - Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides the compute necessary to deploy the SCIM Bridge.
* **AWS Key Management Service and Secrets Manager** - Key Management Service (KMS) key is used to encrypt/decrypt Secrets Manager data. `scimsession` file must be placed into the service prior to deploying your 1Password SCIM Bridge while using this service. Additionally, the SCIM Bridge has to know where to find the `scimsession` file, so please refer to the KMS/SM documentation on how to set that up.
* **AWS S3 Bucket** - This can be used to store the terraform state file, load balancer logs, and so on.
* **AWS Certificate Manager** - Used to manage SSL certificates for your deployment.


## Code Structure

Below is the overall code structure of the Terraform deployment.

- `module_scim_app/` - deploys the following AWS resources and their dependencies: Application Load Balancer (ALB), Auto Scaling Groups (ASG), Identity and Access Management (IAM), instance and load balancer security groups, and a public DNS record.
- `module_scim_infra/` - deploys network infrastructure: Virtual Private Cloud, networking (route tables, etc), Route 53, Internet Gateways, NAT Gateways, and their dependencies.
- `deploy/` - where the deployment files are contained.
    - `{environment}/` - a directory named after the environment youâ€™re deploying to.
        - `user_data/` - contains files related to the specific operating system setup within the container.
            - `01-set-hostname.yml` - hostname options for the OS.
            - `02-environment.yml` - environment variable setup.
            - `03-default-users.yml` - default user setup for the environment (modify if needed).
        - `variables.tf` - sets global variables for the specific deployment and provider configuration. This file already has default values for some of the variables, but it is recommended to review all of them.
        - `providers.tf` - AWS and Terraform provider configuration.
        - `main.tf` - invokes required modules and sets module specific variables.
        - `output.tf` - prints out some of the resources and values.


## Deploying using Terraform

1. Copy `deploy/example_env` to a new directory depending on the environment you wish to deploy to. (e.g: `testing`, `production`, etc)

Example:
```bash
cp -a terraform/deploy/example_env terraform/deploy/{testing,production}
cd terraform/deploy/{testing,production}
```

2. Upload encrypted session file to the AWS Secrets Manager. Replace `<aws_region>` with the region you are deploying to.

Example:
```bash
aws secretsmanager create-secret --name op-scim/scimsession --secret-binary file:///path/to/scimsession --region <aws_region>
aws secretsmanager describe-secret --secret-id op-scim/scimsession --region <aws_region>
```

Custom Key Management Service key can be specified by `--kms-key-id <kms_key>`. Ensure deployed instances have access to that key. If you don't specify key, Secrets Manager will default to using the AWS account's default Customer Master Key (CMK, the one named `aws/secretsmanager`).

3. Adjust `variables.tf`, `main.tf`, `providers.tf`, and `user_data/03-default-users.yml` as required, paying special attention to variables tagged with `CHANGE_ME`.

4. Ensure that you've manually created a certificate for the subdomain you've specified in `variables.tf` in your AWS Certificate Manager. This is not automatically performed by the deployment script.

5. Use the following `terraform` commands to deploy and verify your installation. From the `terraform/deploy/{testing,production}` directory:

```bash
  terraform init
  terraform plan -out=./op-scim.plan
  terraform apply ./op-scim.plan
```

6. Update/Create 1Password SCIM configuration in your Identity Provider using your generated [bearer token](https://github.com/1Password/scim-examples/tree/master/PREPARING.md) and newly-created subdomain.


## Advanced

### Logging

All logs go to `syslog` (AWS EC2 instance OS). You can use the AWS System Manager to view logs for your instance.


### Upgrading and Redeployment

You can destroy and redeploy the instance whenever you feel the need to. No permanent data is stored within the SCIM bridge. This is useful for upgrading your SCIM bridge with important bugfix or feature releases.

`terraform destroy` deletes all but the `scimsession` file in Secrets Manager (deployed separately).


### Debian Package

The 1Password SCIM Bridge is distributed as a Debian package and installed automatically during the deployment process. The following commands are run during the deployment:

```bash
- curl -L https://apt.agilebits.com/gpg.key 2> /dev/null | apt-key add -
- echo '${SCIM_REPO}' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/op-scimrepo.list
- apt-get -y -qq update && apt-get -y -qq install op-scim
- echo '10 * * * * root /usr/local/bin/op-scim-upgrade.sh 2>&1 | logger -t op-scim-deploy-cron' > /etc/cron.d/50_op-scim && chmod 0644 /etc/cron.d/50_op-scim
```
