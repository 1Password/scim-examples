# 1Password SCIM Bridge deployment examples

You can deploy 1Password SCIM Bridge on any supported infrastructure that allows ingress from your identity provider and egress to 1Password servers. Here you'll find configuration files and best practices to help with your deployment.

## Before you begin

Before you begin deploying 1Password SCIM Bridge,

- learn more about [automating provisioning in 1Password using SCIM](https://support.1password.com/scim/).
- review the [Preparation Guide](/PREPARATION.md). The guide will help you plan for some of the technical components of the deployment and consider some issues you may encounter along the way.

## Cloud platforms examples

## Generic examples

For physical server or virtual machine on-premise or custom cloud deployments:

- [Docker](/docker)
- [Kubernetes](/kubernetes)
- [Helm Chart](https://github.com/1Password/op-scim-helm/tree/main/charts/op-scim-bridge)

## Choosing a deployment method

The choice of deployment method depends on your available or preferred cloud service provider or infrastructure, as well as the platform and tooling that you use or prefer. All deployment examples are based on the same container image for 1Password SCIM Bridge that is pulled from Docker Hub.
Here are some additional details to help you make an informed choice:

### Marketplace apps deployments

For a guided deployment of 1Password SCIM Bridge that connects to your 1Password account to automatically generate and load credentials from 1Password, choose a marketplace app. These are off-the-shelf deployments that are not customizable, require creating a public DNS record, and have strict networking requirements.

We publish these apps to [DigitalOcean Marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/1password-scim-bridge) and [Google Cloud Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/agilebits-public/op-scim-bridge).

### Containers as a Service deployments

Many cloud service providers offer **Containers as a Service** (or **Platform as a Service**) deployment platforms. These solutions include DNS and TLS certificate management out-of-the-box for a speedier deployment with a much lower expected cost and burden of maintenance. These examples are suitable for use in a production environment, include common configuration options, and can used a base for your own custom deployment.

We include examples for Azure Container Apps, Google Cloud Run, and DigitalOcean App Platform.

### Beta deployments

Our beta deployment examples represent early efforts to provide a working solution using some new platform or tooling. Each uses the same container image as our stable deployment examples. These deployments _should_ work, but aren't guaranteed and may change in the future.

See the [README](/beta/README.md) in the `/beta` directory for more information about this designation.

## Deprecated deployment examples

A list of recently-deprecated deployments can be found in [`/deprecated`](./deprecated/). At the time of deprecation, these deployments were fully functional, but will soon become unsupported.

We sometimes deprecate deployment examples that become irrelevant, usually when a new deployment example is released that is a more desirable solution for that cloud service provider or platform.

### Recently deprecated

- [Docker Compose & Docker Swarm](https://github.com/1Password/scim-examples/blob/main/deprecated/docker)
See the [README](/deprecated/README.md) in the `/deprecated` directory for more information about this designation and suggested alternatives.
