# Deploy 1Password SCIM Bridge on Azure Container Apps using the Azure Portal

_Learn how to deploy 1Password SCIM Bridge on the [Azure Container Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-apps/#overview) service._

This deployment consists of two [containers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/containers): One for the SCIM bridge and another for Redis. There's also an [ingress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/ingress-overview) for the SCIM bridge container. There are a few benefits to deploying 1Password SCIM Bridge on Azure Container Apps:

- **Low cost:** For standard deployments, the service will host your SCIM bridge for ~$16 USD/month (as of January 2024). Container Apps pricing is variable based on activity, and you can learn more on [Microsoft's pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/container-apps/).
- **Automatic DNS record management:** You don't need to manage a DNS record. Azure Container Apps automatically provides a unique one for your SCIM bridge domain.
- **Automatic TLS certificate management:** Azure Container Apps automatically handles TLS certificate management on your behalf.
- **Multiple deployment options:** The SCIM bridge can be deployed directly to Azure from the Portal using this guide or via the Azure Shell or command line tools in your local terminal using the [support guide](https://support.1password.com/scim-deploy-azure/). If you're using a custom deployment, cloning this repository is recommended.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, complete the necessary [preparation steps to deploy 1Password SCIM Bridge](/PREPARATION.md). You'll also need an Azure account with permission to create a Container App.

## Step 1: Download the template file
1. Navigate to this page and download the template file using the download icon at the top right.

## Step 2: Create the Container App

1. Sign in to the Azure Portal and go to the [Deploy a custom template](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template) page.
2. Click **Build your own template in the editor**.
3. Click **Load file** and upload the template file you downloaded earlier. Then click **Save**.
4. Fill out the following fields:
   - **Subscription** : Choose the subscription you prefer.
   - **Resource group**: Choose an existing Resource Group or create a new one using **Create new** button.
   - **Region**: Choose the region you prefer.
   - **Container App Name**: Enter a name you'd like to use, default will be `op-scim-con-app`.
   - **Container App Env Name**: Enter a name you'd like to use, default will be `op-scim-con-app-env`.
   - **Container App Log Analytics Name**: Enter a name you'd like to use, default will be `op-scim-con-app-env`.
   - **Scimsession** : Paste the plain-text contents of the `scimession` file.
3. Click **Review + create**.
4. Once the validation succeeds, click **Create**. It will take a couple of minutes to run the deployment.


## Step 3: Test your SCIM bridge
Once your deployment is complete, click **Go to resource group** and click on the Container App you created.

To test if your SCIM bridge is online, choose **Overview** in your application's sidebar, then click your **Application Url** link. This is your **SCIM bridge URL**. Sign in using your bearer token to verify that your SCIM bridge is connected to your 1Password account.

## Step 4: Connect your identity provider

To finish setting up automated user provisioning, [connect your identity provider to the SCIM bridge](https://support.1password.com/scim/#step-3-connect-your-identity-provider).

### If Google Workspace is your identity provider

Follow the steps in this section to connect your SCIM bridge to Google Workspace.

<summary>Connect Google Workspace using the Azure Portal</summary>

#### 4.1: Get your Google Workspace service account key

Follow the steps to [create a Google service account, key, and API client](https://support.1password.com/scim-google-workspace/#step-1-create-a-google-service-account-key-and-api-client).

#### 4.2: Download and edit the Google Workspace settings template

1. Download the [`workspace-settings.json`](./google-workspace/workspace-settings.json) file from this repo.
2. Edit the following in this file:
   - **Actor**: Enter the email address of the Google Workspace administrator for the service account.
   - **Bridge Address**: Enter your SCIM bridge domain. This is the Application URL for your Container App, found on the overview page (**not** your 1Password account sign-in address). For example: `https://op-scim-bridge.example.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io`.
3. Save the file.

#### 4.3: Create secrets for Google Workspace

1. Open the Azure Portal and go to the [Container Apps](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.App%2FcontainerApps) page.
2. Choose **Secrets** from the Settings section in the sidebar.
3. Open the key file generated by Google for your service account you saved to your computer in [6.1](#61-get-your-google-workspace-service-account-key).
4. Click **Add** to create a secret for the credentials file, then fill out the following fields:
   - **Key**: Enter `workspace-credentials`.
   - **Value**: Copy the entire contents of the key file. Paste it into this field.
5. Click **Add**, then wait until the secret is created.
6. Open the settings file you edited in [6.2](#62-download-and-edit-the-google-workspace-settings-template).
7. Click **Add** to create another secret for the settings file, then fill out the following fields:
   - **Key**: Enter `workspace-settings`.
   - **Value**: Copy the entire contents of the settings file. Paste it into this field.
8. Click **Add**, then wait until the secret is created.

#### 4.4: Connect your SCIM bridge to Google Workspace

2. Click **Edit and deploy**
3. Choose **Volumes**.
4. Click on the **credentials** volume listed to edit the volume.
5. Deselect **Mount all secrets**.

## Update your SCIM bridge in the Azure Portal

> [!TIP]
> Check for 1Password SCIM Bridge updates on the [SCIM bridge releases notes website](https://releases.1password.com/provisioning/scim-bridge/).

1. Within your deployed 1Password SCIM Bridge Container App in the [Azure Container Apps Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.App%2FcontainerApps), select **Containers** from the sidebar.
2. Click **Edit and deploy**.
3. Select the checkbox next to your **op-scim-bridge** container, then choose **Edit**.
4. Change the version number **2.9.5** in the **Image and Tag** field, **1password/scim:v2.9.5** to match the latest version from our [SCIM bridge releases notes website](https://releases.1password.com/provisioning/scim-bridge/).
5. Select **Save**.
6. Select **Create** to deploy a new revision using the updated image.
7. Enter your SCIM bridge URL in a browser and sign in with your bearer token.
8. Check the top left-hand side of the page to verify you're running the updated version of the SCIM bridge.

After you sign in to your SCIM bridge, the [Automated User Provisioning page](https://start.1password.com/integrations/active/) in your 1Password account will also update with the latest access time and SCIM bridge version.

## Appendix: Resource recommendations

The pod for 1Password SCIM Bridge should be vertically scaled if you provision a large number of users or groups. These are our default resource specifications and recommended configurations for provisioning at scale:

| Volume    | Number of users | CPU  | memory |
| --------- | --------------- | ---- | ------ |
| Default   | <1,000          | 0.25 | 0.5Gi  |
| High      | 1,000â€“5,000     | 0.5  | 1.0Gi  |
| Very high | >5,000          | 1.0  | 1.0Gi  |

If you're provisioning more than 1,000 users, update the resources assigned to [the SCIM bridge container](#22-continue-creating-the-container-app) to follow these recommendations. The resources specified for the Redis container don't need to be adjusted. Steps can be found on our [Advanced guide](ADVANCED.md) on how to update your resources.
